                            <p>Sandhya personally taste-tests every single item before it makes it to your office. She considers flavor, texture, uniqueness, dietary accommodations, and whether it sparks joy during that 3pm energy crash.</p>
                            <p>She also takes requests seriously and builds monthly themes around seasonal ingredients, international flavors, or whatever the office is craving.</p>

                            <p>Sandy refreshes the selection monthly, usually at the beginning of each month. You'll get an email (and maybe some excited office chatter) when the new collection arrives.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes there are surprise mid-month additions if Sandy discovers something too good to wait for!</p>

                                <li>Artisanal snacks</li>

                            <p>Yes! Sandy loves hearing what people are craving. Whether it's "something spicy," "more international flavors," or "I saw this amazing thing on Instagram," she takes all requests seriously.</p>
                            <p>She can't guarantee every request will make it into the collection (some things are impossible to source or way too expensive), but she definitely tries to incorporate subscriber feedback into her monthly themes.</p>
