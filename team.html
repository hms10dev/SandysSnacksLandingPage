                        The software engineer who couldn't resist turning Sandy's snack genius into a proper app. When not writing Java code or hosting coworking sessions for her community, you'll find her deep in Spring or Flutter documentation, currently living the dream of building real things humans actually want to use (instead of yet another todo app). Spends way too much time perfecting animations that probably no one will notice, but hey, that's what makes it fun.

                    <h2 class="font-display">How Sandy's Snacks came to be</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                        It all started with a simple observation: <span class="highlight">office snacks are universally terrible</span>. You know the scene‚Äîstale crackers in the break room, that vending machine with the suspicious expiration dates, the eternal debate over who should buy snacks and what they should get.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Sandhya, being Sandhya, had already solved this problem for herself and her lucky desk neighbors through careful curation and taste-testing. Her desk drawer was legendary‚Äîfull of artisanal treats, international discoveries, and perfectly balanced sweet-and-savory options. Colleagues started making pilgrimages to "Sandy's snack stash" whenever they needed an afternoon pick-me-up.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        That's when the lightbulb went off. What if we could scale Sandy's expertise? What if everyone could benefit from her ridiculously high standards and adventurous palate? <span class="highlight">What if we turned snack curation into a subscription service that actually made sense?</span>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Fast-forward through many late-night coding sessions, countless snack taste-tests, and probably too many matcha lattes‚Äîand here we are. A simple $5/month subscription that transforms your office snack game while supporting a real human who genuinely cares about what you're eating.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        We're not trying to disrupt the snack industry or become the next unicorn startup. We just wanted to solve a very real problem for very real people in our very real office. The fact that other people want in on Sandy's expertise? Well, that's just the cherry on top of a very well-curated sundae.
